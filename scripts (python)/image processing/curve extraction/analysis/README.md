- find speed that minimize pixel resolution loss and maximize shape fidelity, stability, and pixel pitch 
 - shape fidelity (dist from obs curve to target curve) -> heatmap speed/width
 - shape stability (dist from obs curve to other obs curve) -> heatmap speed/width
 - pixel resolution (missed columns) -> heatmap speed/width
 - pixel pitch (dist from obs width to target width)  -> heatmap speed/width
