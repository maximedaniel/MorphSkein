A catenary curve is the shape that a flexible, uniform chain or cable assumes when supported only at its endpoints and subjected to its own weight. To compute a catenary curve, you need to know the following parameters:





Cable length (L): This is the distance between the two endpoints of the cable.

Cable weight per unit length (w): This is the weight of a small section of the cable per unit length.

Horizontal distance between the endpoints (h): This is the horizontal distance between the two points at which the cable is suspended.

Cable tension (T): This is the tension in the cable, which is equal to the weight of the cable divided by the cable length.

With these parameters, you can use the catenary equation to calculate the shape of the cable as a function of its position along the length of the cable. The catenary equation is given by:

y = (h / 2L) * (cosh(x / h) - 1)
where x is the horizontal position along the length of the cable and y is the vertical position.1


Ok, compute me the catenary curve given these parameters:

Cable length (L): 50cm

Cable weight per unit length (w): 40gm

Horizontal distance between the endpoints (h): 15cm

Revolution per Minute (RPM): 450RPM

Cable tension (T): This is the tension in the cable, which is equal to the weight of the cable divided by the cable length.

With these parameters, you can use the catenary equation to calculate the shape of the cable as a function of its position along the length of the cable. The catenary equation is given by:


compute the skipping rope curve using these parameters:

Rope length (L): 30cm

Rope density (ρ): 45gm

Revolution per minute (RPM): 450RPM

Radius of curvature (r): 20cm
